# why i like tabpfn?

# how to understand tabpfn?

think of tabpfn as a experienced accountant. mr tabpfn has seen many financial tables in his life (pretraining). and now got hired for a job to fix some company. using his experience he looks at the tables of the company and makes new predictions for the new data that is not known(inference). he learned to do these predictions by looking at and comparing all columns of the table (feature attention) and all the rows of the table (sample attention) and then relating the new cases he got with the what he looked at the given table (in context learning)
